# Autoscaling-
- Autoscaling is the feature that automatically permits you to increase or decrease your resources to meet demand.

# Benefits of Autoscaling-
- **Improved Performance:** Automatically adjusts resources to maintain application performance during high demand periods.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces costs by scaling down resources during low demand periods, so you're not paying for unused capacity.
- **Reliability:** Helps maintain high availability and reliability by responding to changes in demand and avoiding potential overloads.

# Horizontal Scaling-
Horizontal Scaling involves adding more instances of a resource to distribute the load across multiple machines or nodes. 

# Vertical Scaling-
Vertical Scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single instance or server, such as upgrading its CPU, memory, or storage.

# Manual Scaling – 
- In Manual Scaling, the number of instances is manually adjusted.
- You can manually increase or decrease the number of instances through a CLI or console. 

# Dynamic Scaling – 
- This is yet another type of Auto Scaling in which the number of EC2 instances is changed automatically depending on the signals received.
- Dynamic Scaling is a good choice when there is a high volume of unpredictable traffic.
