# Autoscaling-
- Autoscaling is the feature that automatically permits you to increase or decrease your resources to meet demand.

# Benefits of Autoscaling-
- **Improved Performance:** Automatically adjusts resources to maintain application performance during high demand periods.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces costs by scaling down resources during low demand periods, so you're not paying for unused capacity.
- **Reliability:** Helps maintain high availability and reliability by responding to changes in demand and avoiding potential overloads.

# Horizontal Scaling-
Horizontal Scaling involves adding more instances of a resource to distribute the load across multiple machines or nodes. 

# Vertical Scaling-
Vertical Scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single instance or server, such as upgrading its CPU, memory, or storage.
