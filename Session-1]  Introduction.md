# Cloud Computing-

- Cloud Computing is on-demand delivery of Computing services over the internet.
- These services include servers, storage, compute, databases and networking.
- Cloud Computing also referred as the accessing and storing of data. The data can be anything like images, videos, audios, documents, files etc.
- Cloud providers is the ‘Pay as you go’ principle-based services i.e. you only have to pay for the service which you are using.

# Cloud Service Providers-
- Cloud computing is in huge demand so, big organization providing the Cloud services are called as Cloud Service Providers.
- Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba cloud, IBM cloud, Oracle cloud and VMware Cloud etc. are some Cloud Computing service Provider.

# On-premises VS Cloud-

| Feature                  | On-Premises                                 | Cloud Computing                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure Location** | Physical location within the organization | Hosted by cloud service provider, accessed over the internet |
| **Initial Costs**        | High upfront costs for hardware and software | Lower upfront costs, pay-as-you-go model  |
| **Maintenance**          | Handled internally by the organization      | Managed by the cloud provider             |
| **Scalability**          | Requires purchasing and installing hardware | Easily scalable up or down based on demand |
| **Control**              | Complete control over hardware and data     | Less control over hardware, but manage applications and data configurations |
| **Security**             | Managed internally, requires expertise      | Managed by the provider with advanced measures; shared responsibility model |
| **Flexibility**          | Less flexible, changes and upgrades take time | Highly flexible, quick deployment of resources and services |


# Cloud Computing Models-
- Cloud architecture can be divided into:

# Deployment Model-
- Based on the amount of data you want to store and who has access to the infrastructure.
- The cloud deployment model identifies the specific type of cloud environment based on ownership, scale, and access, as well as the cloud’s nature and purpose.
- Depolyment model further divided into :
## Public Cloud-
- Anyone can access services or resources from anywhere.
- Managed by the cloud provider.
- Highly scalable, as resources are virtually unlimited.
- Pay-as-you-go model, no need for large upfront investments.
## Private Cloud-
- There is no need to share your hardware with anyone else.
- A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization.
- Managed internally or by a third-party provider.
- Less scalable.
- Higher upfront costs due to the need to purchase and maintain hardware.
# Hybrid Cloud-
- A combination of public and private clouds.
- More costly than public cloud.
- Managing hybrid cloud is difficult.
# Community Cloud-
- It allows system or services to be accessible by group of organization.
- Managed by internally or by third party.
- Cost efficient, as cost shared between community memebers.

# Service Model-

# IaaS-

- Delivers on-demand services or resources.
- provides underlying os, security, storage and networking.etc
- Usually works on pay-as-you-go model.
- You manages everything apart from physical server.
- Overall, it manages infrastructure, so known as hardware as service.

# Paas-
- PaaS provides platform and environment to allow developers to build application or access services.
- Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
- Customer only manages/control deployed application instead of infrastructure.

# Saas- 
- It provides sevices or application over the internet.
- It reduces need of installing and maintaining softwares.
- Instead of installing softwares, we simply access it via internet.
- Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser without any downloads or installations required.
- The SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software.

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Virtualized computing resources   | Hardware and software tools for development | Software applications delivered over the internet |
| **Examples**             | AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP         | Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Services | Google Workspace, Office 365, Salesforce |
| **Use Cases**            | Managing own applications, middleware, and data | Application development and deployment | Access to software applications |
| **Control and Flexibility** | Maximum control and flexibility | Less control over infrastructure | Minimal control |
| **Management Responsibility** | Users manage applications, data, runtime, middleware, OS | Users manage applications and data | Service provider manages everything |
| **Provider's Responsibility** | Service provider manages virtualization, servers, storage, networking | Service provider manages runtime, middleware, OS, virtualization, servers, storage, networking | Users interact only with the application |
