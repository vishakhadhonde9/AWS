- Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience.
- CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.
- When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
