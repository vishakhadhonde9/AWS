# Cloudwatch -
- Amazon CloudWatch(opens in a new tab) is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics.
- CloudWatch uses metrics to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch.
- CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time.

# CloudWatch alarms -
- With CloudWatch, you can create alarms that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold.
- What are the 3 states of the CloudWatch metric alarm:
    - OK—The metric or expression is within the defined threshold.
    - ALARM—The metric or expression is outside of the defined threshold.
    - INSUFFICIENT_DATA—The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.
