# Relational Database and Non-relational Database-
## Relational Database-
- A relational database organizes data into tables. Data in one table can link to data in other tables to create relationships.
- A table stores data in rows and columns. A row, often called a record, contains all information about a specific entry.
- With a relational database management system (RDBMS), you can create, update, and administer a relational database.
- Some common examples of RDBMSs include the following:
    - MySQL
    - PostgresQL
    - Oracle
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - Amazon Aurora

## Non-relational Database-
- The non-relational database, or NoSQL database, stores data.
- However, unlike the relational database, there are no tables, rows, primary keys or foreign keys.
- Instead, the non-relational database uses a storage model optimized for specific requirements of the type of data being stored.
- Some of the more popular NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase and Apache HBase.
