# VPC Peering-
- VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPC that allows them to communicate with each other as if they were part of the same network.
- It enables private connectivity between resources in different VPCs.
  
- **Transitive Peering-**
  - VPC peering does not support transitive routing, meaning you cannot route traffic through a peered VPC to reach another VPC.
  - To connect multiple VPCs, you need to establish direct peering connections between each pair of VPCs

# AWS Direct Connect-
- AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated connection from an on-premises network to one or more VPCs.
