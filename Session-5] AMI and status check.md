# Amazon Machine Image 

- An AMI is composed of the following components:
    - Root volume template: This is the primary storage for the instance, containing the operating system and other pre-installed software.
    - Launch permissions: These define who can use the AMI to launch instances.
    - Block device mappings: These specify the additional storage volumes (EBS volumes) to be attached to the instance at launch time
