# Remote Access To Machines-

- **What is RDP?**
     - The Remote Desktop Protocol is solely used for accessing Windows virtual machines (VMs) and physical Windows servers.
     - Port: Default port is 3389.
     - From a user perspective, RDP provides a Windows Graphical User Interface (GUI) experience, making servers more accessible to a wider range of employees  with or without a technical background.
 
- **What is SSH?**
    - Secure Shell is a protocol optimized for Linux server access, but usable across any operating systemâ€™s server.
    - Port: Default port is 22.
    - Unlike RDP, SSH has no GUI, only command line interfacing, which is generally controlled through bash. As such, SSH is technically demanding for end users, and even more technically demanding to set up.
